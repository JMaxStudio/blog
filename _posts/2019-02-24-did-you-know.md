As with any open source project, developers usually don't have the time to keep up with everything that is going on. As such, some things are missed that could potentially help developers. Phalcon is no different, and despite the fact that we have a very "observant" community, we thought we would outline a few things that you might have missed

### Main Repository

#### NFRs
We had a great number of NFRs that have been sitting in GitHub as issues and never got any attention. In an effort to prioritize our time and allocate resources towards addressing the most requested NFRs, we have an [issue](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/issues/13855) in GitHub open, offering a platform to voice your opinion. Feel free to share your thoughts on which NFRs matter to you most!

#### Queue
`Phalcon\Queue\Beanstalk` is dead, long live `Phalcon\Queue`. As mentioned in our recent hangout, the Queue component has been removed because Beanstalkd is nearly (if not completely) dead as a project. As such we need to offer something to the community for Queue needs. There are some options we can explore, so feel free to check [this issue](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/issues/13851) and give us some feedback.
