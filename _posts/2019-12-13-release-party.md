It has been a long journey. Nearly 3,000 commits and a lot of refactoring and cleaning up!

We released [v4.0.0.alpha1](/post/merry-christmas-and-phalcon-4.0.0-alpha1-released) last year on Christmas Day. We wanted to release the v4 stable again on Christmas Day as a present to our community, but scheduling conflicts did not allow us to do this, therefore you are getting your Christmas present a few days early!

Join us for a live release hangout, to celebrate the release of v4 and just hang out. We will not be able to provide drinks but we will have screen sharing, compilation of the extension, release, Travis runs and house music!


As you might have noticed, we made some significant changes with regards to the project. Some highlights:
- Started closing old issues and reorganizing our GitHub [link](/post/github-closing-old-issues)
- Reorganized all our repositories [link](/post/repository-reorganization)
- Created a new environment based on [Nanobox](https://nanobox.io) to help with setting up Phalcon locally and being able to develop on it [link](/post/local-development-environment)
- Started engaging the community every month with a hangout at the end of each month [link](/post/community-hangout-2019-01-26)
- Increased our Social Media presence
- Rolled out brand new websites with a fresh design and easier navigation (Thanks to [O2](https://odva.pro)
- Increased the core team members
- and much more!
