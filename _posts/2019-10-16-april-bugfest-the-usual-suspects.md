Back in April, we announced the [April Bugfest](post/competition-2019-april-bugfest) competition, The rules were simple: fix bugs, we will send you a t-shirt!

The competition was a big success. We got a good chunk of issues done and the contributions spanned throughout the whole organization: from the main repository, devotols, documents etc.

We were supposed to post the results of the competition a few months ago but wanted to wait a bit for contributors to receive their gifts and send us pictures. 

So without any more delays, here are _The Usual Suspects_ - members of the community

### Thank you

A huge thank you to all that contributed. There were a few more contributors that opted not to send a picture. 

We intend on having this competition every year so looking forward to our April Bugfest 2020
